# An advection solver

We wish to solve the advection equations
$$
\partial_tf_i+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla f_i=0
$$
where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field and $f_i$ are a list of
passive tracers.  This can be done with a flux-based advection scheme
such as the 2nd-order, unsplit, upwind scheme of [Bell-Collela-Glaz,
1989](references.bib#bell89).

The main time loop is defined in [run.h](). A stable timestep needs to
respect the [CFL
condition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition). */

/**
We allocate the (face) velocity field. For compatibility with the
other solvers, we allocate it as `uf` and define an alias. The
`gradient` function is used to set the type of slope-limiting
required. The default is to not use any limiting (i.e. a purely
centered slope estimation). */

* 'stability()' where the velocity and the timestep are set,
* 'vof()' which advects a VOF tracer if [vof.h]() is included,
* 'tracer_advection()' and 'tracer_diffusion()' to advect (with [tracer.h]())
and make diffuse tracers,
* 'adapt()' to adapt the mesh. */
